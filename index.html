					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Mathew Potts. I am a Ph.D. canidate from the Univerity of Utah and I plan on graduating in May of 2022. My thesis research with the Telescope Array (TA) Cosmic Ray Observatory focused on detecting ultra-high energy particles that interact with Earth's atmosphere. I calculated a cosmic ray energy spectrum of TA's newest detector, TAx4, using a hybrid detection technique to better understand the flux of cosmic rays at the highest energies.
					</p>

						My research interests are to test the standard models of particle physics and cosmology by searching for new phenomena. These paradigms are intricately linked, and there has been tantalizing evidence of new physics with exciting experiments in the areas of neutrinos, dark matter, and cosmic rays. The large scientific interest in these experiments leads me to believe that the fields of high-energy particle physics and cosmology are on the verge of a new period of discovery. To meet this great potential, I have chosen to pursue anomalies in the cosmic ray sector and in cosmology through new physics searches. I believe progress in these areas will depend critically on higher precision measurements and global collaboration between experiments.
