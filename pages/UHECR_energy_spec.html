						<p>
							I spent 5 years at the University of Utah conducting my Ph.D. thesis research with the Telescope Array Cosmic Ray Observatory with the help of Charles Jui (my thesis advisor) studying the Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) energy spectrum. My thesis focuses on collecting, processing, and reconstructing data of the new Telescope Array expansion (TAx4) using a hybrid analysis. Hybrid analysis utilizes information from both Surface Detector (SD) and Flourescence Detector (FD) to constrain the reconstructed shower's "Timing verse Angle" fit. This method of event reconstruction has a significantly improved resolution over monocular analyses. My analysis has yielded the first TAx4 hybrid cosmic ray energy spectrum. I also report the performance of TAx4 and present data-MC comparisions.

						understood. The variation of the cosmic ray flux with energy is referred to as the "Energy Spectrum.‚Äù Themeasurement of the cosmic ray energy spectrum is important because it may give a hint of where cosmic rays come from. The Telescope Array(TA) Cosmic Ray Observatory, located in Millard County Utah, is the largest cosmic ray detector in the Northern hemisphere. Following
						evidence for a hotspot in the arrival directions of the highest energy
						cosmic rays, TA underwent the TAx4 upgrade to expand the area of
						Surface Detectors (SD) by a factor of 4. The upgrade included new
						Fluorescence Detector (FD) stations to view over the expanded SD
						arrays. In this work, I will present a preliminary cosmic ray energy
						spectrum using hybrid events from TAx4, the hybrid resolutions of the
						detector, and data-MC comparisons. I will show this work's preliminary
						hybrid energy spectrum is in agreement with previous TA
						measurements, which is a key first step towards future composition and
						anisotropy studies.

					<h3 id="UHECR_HYB">TAx4 Hybrid Cosmic Ray Detector</h3>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em;">TA has found hints of anisotropy of UHECRs in the northern hemisphere. Using the TA SD data, there were 72 events found with E > 57 EeV (5.7x10<sup>19</sup> eV) that showed a clustering of events with a 3.4 sigma significance. This clustering has been coined the <i>hotspot</i>. To better observe and understand the nature of the hotspot, TA is quadrupling its size. This expansion was accordingly named <i>TAx4</i>. 500 new Surface Detectors (SDs) are being added spread over two lopes to the north and south of the main TA array. The new SD arrays will be overlooked by 12 new Fluorescence Detector telescopes (FDs). TAx4 will increase TA's detection aperture and increase the number of UHECR events detected. One of the primary goals of TAx4 is to improve the statistical significance of the hotspot and TA's statistics overall at the highest energies. Below is map of all of TA, including TALE and TAx4. The red dots are the SD locations and overlayed on the map are photos of the FD sites. &nbsp;</p>

				  </center>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em;">The twelve new Fluorescence detector (FD) telescopes were added at the BR and MD FD station sites, four at MD and eight at BR. TAx4MDFD, overlooking the TAx4 northern SD array, was completed in February of 2018; after several of months of detector commissioning, regular data-taking began. TAx4BRFD, overlooking the TAx4 southern SD array, was completed in July of 2019. Detector commissioning was extended because of the need to prepare this station for remote operation from Middle Drum. This effort was further delayed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it imposed on work. Nevertheless, regular observation did start in July, 2020.&nbsp;</p>

				  <h3 id="UHECR_MC">Monte Carlo</h3>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em;">Complex Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to determine the detectors responce to cosmic ray events, detector aperture, and determine detector resolutions. The MC used in this analysis was generated using QGSJetII-03 protons. The MC is constructed in such a way that it is indistingishable from the data, then the same reconstruction programs that are used on the data are used on the MC. The validity of the MC can then be determined by comparing distributions of observables produced in the data.</p>

					<h3 id="UHECR_data">Data Set</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">I am using about two years of data taken from the TAx4 detectors (2019/06/26 - 2021/10/28). The plot below shows the event energy distribution of the TAx4 data. TAx4 North can be seen in red, TAx4 south is in blue, and the combined distribution is black. TAx4 North has 70 events and TAx4 south has 89 events that pass this works quality cuts and weather cuts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

					<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The hybrid spectrum measured using the SDs and FDs of TAx4 using approximately 2 years of data is in reasonable agreement with the previously published TA Combined Spectrum.</p>
