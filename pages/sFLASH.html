						<p>
							As an undergraduate working with The Telescope Array Project (TA), I was given the opportunity to work on the sFLASH experiment at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, USA. The primary goals of the Super Fluorescence AirSHower experiment, sFLASH, are to reduce the systematic uncertainty on the air fluorescence measurement and to study the air fluorescence yield dependence on the shower development. To achieve these goals, we conducted two experiments. During the 2016 experiment we measured the absolute air fluorescence yield. We used this result to normalize the results of the second experiment, conducted in 2018, and we aimed to study the air fluorescence yield dependence on the shower development stage.

							In our group, I lead the quality check of the data, ensuring that the beam energy was stable throughout the run. I worked with colleagues on the photo-multiplier calibration both before the experiments and in situ. There has been a delay in sFLASH’s analyses due to the COVID-19 outbreak and anomalies within the second 2018 experiment, but we are actively working through it and plan to publish our findings soon.

						<h3 id="SF_AFY">What is Air Flourescense Yield?</h3>
						<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
							The air flourescense technique for detecting cosmic rays has been around since the mid-60s; it involves observing the cascade of secondary particles that is incidiated by a cosmic ray. The energy of the primary cosmic ray is related to the total amount of the fluorescence light emitted by the cascade, called an extensive air shower (EAS). An important parameter to measuring the energy is the Air Flourescense Yield (AFY). The AFY is a conversion factor between the light profile and physical interpretation of the showers and expresses the number of photons produced by a charged particle per unit interaction length.

						<h3 id="SF_pre">Pre-SLAC</h3>
						<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
							Before the first 2016 experiment at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center(SLAC), I was reponsible for the calibration of the Photonis PMTs and the purchase of a blackout blind that would be used for background light control. 
						</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
							The experiment planned on using two different types of PMTs: Hamamatsu and Photonis. These tubes were used in “CRAYS” and “HiRes” experiments, repectively . The PMTs were calibrated independently at University of Utah ("Photonis") and at ICRR ("CRAYS") in Japan.  The calibration was performed by calibrated UV LEDs during the data taking.  We calibrated PMTs by two different types of calibration systems: CRAYS and Roving Xenon Flasher, RXF, which is the standard candle for the TA experiment. The CRAYS consists of a 337.1 nm pulse laser and a N2 filled scattering chamber. The PMT is attached to the chamber normal to laser beam and illuminated by 90<sup>◦</sup> Rayleigh scattered  photons. The signal is read out by a WaveJet 354A oscilloscope.  The calibration uncertainty by CRAYS was estimated 6.5%.  The RXF consists of a 355 nm Xenon bulb producing μs pulse and a diffuser. It is calibrated by a NIST certified Hybrid Photodiode system, HPD. The PMT is calibrated by the RXF at adistance of 2 m in dark room with 6% error. I was responsible for calibrating the Photonis tubes before the experiment. After AFY measurement, we cross-checked both types of PMTs calibration constants using CRAYS which agree within the systematic error.  For the on-site PMT monitoring and calibration, we use a temperature stabilized UV LED light source and small light source YAP (YAlO<sub>3</sub>).  The UV LED is portable calibration  light  emitting  369  nm wavelength photons set 4m away from the PMTs and 1.15m from the ground to avoid obscuration of air fluorescence photons.  The YAP consists of an α source and a scintillator to emit photons built into a 4mm diameter alumina can.  It is set at the UV filter at PMT window and injected photon directly into the photocathode.  The YAP confirmed the stability of the calibration constants during the experiment.

							The blackout curtain was used to measure the  background and was made from aluminized Mylar. The background was measured by "blind” PMTs (PMTs wrapped in blackpaper) and by “signal” PMTs by periodically closing a remotely controlled shutter.
